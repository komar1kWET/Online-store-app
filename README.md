# OnlineStore
In this project, you can store products. <br>
Admin account<br>
<b>login</b>: admin, <br>
<b>password</b>: admin

User login and password store in localStorage.
When you loggIn as admin, you can add, remove, edit products.
<br>
In admin mode you can also consumer view. <br>
For consumer available search form, where you can search concrete product and choose him. <br>
Also available filter drop-down menu, where you can filter products by price. <br>
For me, it was a novelty to write guard, so that it was impossible to go through a direct link to the admin panel. <br>
In the future I plan to receive data from the MongoDB database by writing endpoints using Node.js and Express.js
